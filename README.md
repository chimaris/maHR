# MaHR Consulting Landing Page

Created an engaging human resource landing page using Next.js. The page included the following key features: a Navbar, a Hero Section, an About Us section detailing our mission and vision, a Services section, and a Footer.

I utilized a color palette of blue, white, and slate for a fresh and modern look, and also make it responsive across all devices.
